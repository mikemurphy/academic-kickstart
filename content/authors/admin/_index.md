I grew up in Glasgow, Scotland and am currently a Senior Research Analyst at the International Food Policy Research Institute and a PhD student in economics at the University of Bordeaux. My primary research interest is in the role of risk and uncertainty in decision-making, in the context of agriculture in developing economies.
